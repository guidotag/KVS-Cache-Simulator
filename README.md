In "Small Cache, Big Effect: Provable Load Balancing for Randomly Partitioned Cluster Services", it is shown, theoretically and empirically, that for a distributed key-value store randomly partitioned over n back-end nodes, a front-end cache with O(n log n) items guarantees that no node will ever be overloaded. We take the most significant experiments and build a simulator to mimic them. Our results match the paperâ€™s to a great extent.
